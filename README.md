# Spider4Autohome
that's a simple spider for EV, PHEV, EREV consumers comments. with ttf processing and OCR, the project worked out ttf-anti-spider of Autohome.
Another spider for comment urls is not uploaded cuz it's quite easy.

The key of this project is to convert ttf to imgs, which will be recognized as actual characters labled by unicode.
Too much useless and pasted codes resulted from lazybones.
OCR API from Baidu and Xunfei, u can get 50k times general and 500 times accurate from Baidu and 500 times from Xunfei every day. Xunfei did a much more accurate job than Baidu.

Converting ttf to imgs cost nearly 30 seconds once, which accounts for 80% of the whole crawling process.

any question about the project and comment data, contact B2Purple@40oz.cc
